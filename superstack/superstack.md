# SuperStack<sup>TM</sup> RTOS

SuperStack is designed for AI and Machine Learning on the Edge, without all the headache of setting up a wireless stack or struggling with embedded system architectures.

Simply connect your sensors, upload your algorithms remotely, and start reading and writing data with the built in web ready JSON API.

![SuperStack General Workflow]()

## Workflows

Add, remove and reconfigure sensors on the fly. Change reporting intervals, sensitivity, and may other parameters quickly and easily when needed.

![SuperStack Sensor Configuration]()

 Create conditional scripting to send back notifications when events occur.

![SuperStack Conditional Events]()

Upload you custom algorithms, AI or ML Models and easily configure them to work in tandem with connected sensors.

![SuperStack FPGA Upload]()

Store important data locally, preprocess and obfuscate sensitive user data on the edge. Only send what's needed to the cloud and save bandwidth and ensure user privacy.

![SuperStack Storage and Privacy]()

Securely manage your fleet of devices and update fully remotely with our qualified infrastructure.
