## S1 Module

The built-in S1 Module is designed for IoT projects where performance is key, yet space and power constraints cannot be compromised.

**It features a clever combination of four ICs.**

- A Bluetooth 5.2 SoC
- An FPGA designed for low power AI/ML
- A complete battery management IC
- And 32Mb of flash memory

Additionally, the module breaks out high speed IO and several adjustable power rails so that your design can remain compact.

To read more about the S1 Module, be sure to check out the full datasheet [here](/s1-module/s1-module).
