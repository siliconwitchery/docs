# `machine` â€“ Functions related to the hardware

---

The `machine` class contains all of the classes and methods to control the S1 Module. Import it with:

```python
import machine
```

To see what's contained inside the class you can use the `help()` command:

```python
help(machine)
```

## Classes

`machine.Pin` 

- Functions related to the nRF GPIO pins. **See more info [here](/micropython/pin)**

`machine.ADC`
    
- Functions related to the nRF ADC. **See more info [here](/micropython/adc)**

`machine.RTC`

- Functions related to the nRF RTC and timing functions. **See more info [here](/micropython/rtc)**

`machine.FPGA`

- Functions related to the iCE40 FPGA. **See more info [here](/micropython/fpga)**

`machine.Flash`

- Functions related to the 32 Mbit flash memory. **See more info [here](/micropython/flash)**

`machine.PMIC`

- Functions related to S1 power, and battery management. **See more info [here](/micropython/pmic)**

## Functions

`machine.mac_address()`

- Returns the 48bit device MAC address in hex format.

`machine.reset()`

- Resets the nRF52, and thus both MicroPython and the Bluetooth connection. **Note that the PMIC configuration remains unchanged** with this type of reset.

`machine.reset_cause()`
    
- Displays one of the following causes for the last reset. After calling this function, the reset cause is cleared to `RESET_CAUSE_NONE`.

    | `RESET_CAUSE_NONE` | No resets since power on, or the reset cause has already been read. |
    | `RESET_CAUSE_SOFT` | Last reset via `machine.reset()` command. |
    | `RESET_CAUSE_LOCKUP` | System reset from CPU lockup or crash. |
    | `RESET_CAUSE_GPIO_WAKE` | System reset from deep sleep using `Pin` interrupt based wake. **See more info [here](/micropython/pin)**. |

`machine.power_down()`

- Puts the device into the lowest power deep sleep. Can only be woken up using a `Pin` interrupt, or power cycle. **Note** to ensure lowest power, follow the sequence below to ensure all other devices are powered down before going to sleep.

    ```python
    FPGA.reset() # Stop the FPGA
    Flash.sleep() # Put the flash IC into deep sleep
    PMIC.battery_level(False) # Disable battery monitoring
    PMIC.fpga_power(False) # Shutdown FPGA power
    PMIC.vaux_config(0) # Turn off the Vaux and Vio rails

    # Remember to set up any Pin based wake if required

    machine.power_down()
    ```

`machine.git_tag`

- Displays the Git tag of the current MicroPython build as a *string*.

`machine.build_date`

- Displays the build date of the current MicroPython build as a *string*.

`machine.board_name`

- Returns the board name as a *string*. Always `s1 module`.

`machine.mcu_name`

-  Returns the MCU name as a *string*. always `nrf52811`.
