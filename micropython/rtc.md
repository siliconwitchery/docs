# `machine.RTC` â€“ Functions to control the real time clock

---

The `machine.RTC` class contains all of the functions to control the nRF52 RTC and timing functions. Import it using

```python
from machine import RTC
```

To see what's contained inside the class you can use the `help()` command

```python
help(RTC)
```

## Functions

`RTC.time(setTime)`

- If `RTC.time()` is called without an argument, it will return the time in seconds since power on, or the last reset

    ```python
    RTC.time()
    4699 # Around 1.3 hours
    ```

- If a value is provided, the internal time is adjusted, and following reads will return the time from then on. **Note** Due to the 30 bit limitation of MicroPython integers, standard epoch time cannot be used. Instead, use a different reference, such as seconds since 1st Jan 2000

    ```python
    RTC.time(705580080) # Set date and time to May 11th 2022, 11:28:00 AM
    
    # 5 minutes later
    RTC.time()
    705580380
    ```

`RTC.sleep_ms(ms)`

- Puts the nRF into a light sleep for a number of milliseconds provided. The device will remain connected, but won't respond until the time is up. This can be used to create simple delays in loops
