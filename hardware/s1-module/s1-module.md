## Description 

The S1 Module is based on a powerful trio of ICs tightly integrated into a flexible circuit board which can be soldered, socketed or even sewn into garments.

The S1 features Bluetooth 5.2 wireless with a preconfiguered and easy to use set of Bluetooth Service Characteristics.

At the heart of the S1 module, a 5k LUT FPGA allows you to deploy custom algorithms and AI/ML models easily for realtime operation. Simply package your bitstream and use our wireless API to remotely deploy your model to the edge.

To round it all off, the S1 features best in class power and charge management which is highly user configurable. The adjustable charge voltage supports many single cell technologies including Li-Ion, Li-Poly and Li-Ceramic batteries, as well as the option to disable charging all together for use with single use batteries such as Lithium or Zinc button cells.

A built in multi output boost convertor allows for up to two user configurable voltage up to 5V from a sinlge cell. This is userful for driving LEDs in heart rate or pulse oximetry sensors.

Finally the device features numerous low power modes to ensure your application runs just as you need without wasting energy under idle.

The S1 is loaded with a magnitude of IO for connecting sensors and other interfaces. It can attached in multiple configurations, ranging from IO requirements, to high speed data transfer.
