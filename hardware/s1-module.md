![Silicon Witchery S1 Module]()

## Description 

An FPGA, Bluetooth Radio and Battery Management IC combined into one tiny form factor.

The S1 module features several high speed IO for connecting sensors or other devices, as well as adjustable voltage output rails for quickly building highly integrated solutions.

The built in battery management allows for charging and monitoring, resulting in a clean and straightforward integration of the module into your final product. Only use the pins you need and ignore the rest. No external component are required for basic operation, with crystals and decoupling capacitors are already integrated.

Should you wish to not develop your own wireless firmware, the module comes preloaded with our SuperStack RTOS which allows anyone to remotely deploy algorithms, read sensors and store data, without the need to deal with any C code. Simply use our JSON API over Bluetooth UART and get a response back with your data. There is ofcourse still the option to re-flash the Bluetooth IC with your own firmware should you choose over the Serial Wire Debug pins.

SuperStack also supports asynchronous notifications, autonomous sleep, firmware updates and loading of your DSP algorithms onto the FPGA without the need to worry about system architecture of any of these features. Simply follow our API and get started with our browser based WebBluetooth test tool (coming soon for Chrome and Edge).

The compact form factor allows for tight integration into existing products where space is limited with a total footprint is 6mm x 12mm and a thickness of just 1.6mm.
